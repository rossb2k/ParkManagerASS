While we want to bring plenty of tourists to enjoy our parks we need to be mindful of the impact on our wildlife. What will be our focus for this week?"

        You decide to prioritize tourism infrastructure. It is imperative to attract new visitors to support the park.

        Emily nods, 'Improving amenities might boost tourism. But remember, it could impact local habitats.'

        You decide that prioritizing tourism is key to saving the park. New funding will be used to improve exisiting amenities, while helping to create new ones.

        You choose to intensify wildlife conservation efforts. We must safeguard the park's ecosystems for the long term. Focusing on strengthening our ecological protections and improving the ecosystem of the park is what's needed. 

        "Emily agrees, 'Conserving wildlife is crucial, but it might decrease immediate tourism. We'll need to find a balance, or else we may lose funding to continue these projects'"

        With new funding the Park will be able to create new scientific initiatives to help the ecosystem of the park. Creating and lobbying for environimental protections will be key to conservation efforts.

        "You opt for controlled tourism expansion with conservation measures. 'Let's welcome visitors responsibly, with strict regulations.'"

        "Emily remarks, 'A balanced approach. Just be cautious with the regulations; it's a delicate balance to strike.'"
